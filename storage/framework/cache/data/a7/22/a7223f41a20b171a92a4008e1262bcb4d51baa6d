With more than 55 stores nationwide Limelight offers various product lines that can click anyone’s heart. Our product range started from women’s formal & casual wear, moving to kids and men’s wear. Limelight’s clothing line includes both stitched and unstitched fabrics so that our customers can choose and adopt the styles of their own. The product portfolio further extends to bottoms, bags, clutches, wallets, wraps, sleepwear, jewellery and accessories. We specialize in embellishments that are incorporated in multiple product lines like shirts & bags.

We strategize to bring colours of east and west; showcasing traditional clothing and western wear side by side for multiple tastes out there. Our goal is to cater fashionistas of all ages. Fresh stock is sent to stores multiples times each week.

We plan to grow both with new stores and online, in existing as well as new markets to make good quality fashion accessible for local and international customers.
